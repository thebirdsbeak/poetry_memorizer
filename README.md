# poetry_memorizer

A gui tool made with PyQt5 and QT Designer to help you memorise poems and speeches.

The main functionality is the ability to type in poems line by line, and apply various levels of obfuscation to increase the difficulty until you are confident the poem is memorised.

Current features:

* Toggle line numbers
* Hide the current line of the text
* Hide entire text
* Randomly obfuscate words (scale of 1 - 5)

In progress:

* Select random poem based on status (learning, memorised, all)
* The ability to edit existing poem

Potential future additions:

* Automatic line entry
* Command line interface
* Importing poem files
* Preferences such as font size
